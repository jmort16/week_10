    "1.\tExplain the dot product and cross product in your own words in markdown. Use LaTeX to properly show the equations.\n",
    "2.\tWrite a function angle_between(v1, v2) where v1 and v2 are two vectors that are passed in, and the angle between them is calculated. \n",
    "3.\tWrite a function called row_dot(A, r1, r2) which takes an input matrix called A, one row number identified by r1, and another row number identified by r2 and returns the dot product of the r1 and r2 rows (indexing starts at 0).\n",
    "4.\tWrite a function matrix_division(m1, m2) that takes in two matrices, m1 and m2, and returns the result. What is the trick with matrix division?\n",
    "5.\tWrite a function is_orthogonal(v1,v2, tol), where v1 and v2 are column vectors of the same size and tol is a scalar value strictly larger than 0. The output should be 1 if the angle between v1 and v2 is within tol of π/2; that is, |π/2−θ|<tol|π/2−θ|<tol, and 0 otherwise. You may assume that v1 and v2 are column vectors of the same size, and that tol is a positive scalar.\n",

    "6.\tCreate a class called vector_calculator. __init__ should take self, vector1, and vector2. It should have two methods inside of it that are from problems 1 and 4 above (angle_between and is_orthogonal). Make sure tol is defaulted but can be overwritten. Make sure you can call angle_between and is_orthogonal through the class and return the correct results as in problems 1 and 4. \n",

This is just exploratory, so there are many correct answers!\n"
