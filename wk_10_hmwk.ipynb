    "The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements in the vectors.  It is a number that gives an indication of the extent to which two vectors move in the same direction.  Two vectors that run perpendicular to one another will have a dot product of zero.  Two vectors that overlap one another (and therefor move in exactly the same direction) will have a dot product equal to the parallel component of the magnitude of one vector in relation to the other multiplied by the magnitude of the other vector.\n",
